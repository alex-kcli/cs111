It can support these following options:

--input=filename 	uses the specified file as standard input. 

--output=filename 	creates the specified file and use it as standard output. 

--segfault 		forces a segmentation fault

--catch 		catches the segmentation fault, logs an error message



Makefile: 
A makefile file that supports compiling the C source file into executable.

It also supports the following:
check: 	runs a set of smoke-tests to determine if the program seem to work 

    Smoke tests:	Checks for normal input and output
			Checks for Wrong option inputted
			Checks for input file access restriction
			Checks for output file access restriction
			Checks for catching segfault


clean:	deletes all files created by Makefile, resets the directory to the original state

dist:	creates tarball for distribution
